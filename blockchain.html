                        <h2>Working Principles</h2>
                        <p>Blockchain technology operates through a decentralized ledger system. Each transaction is
                            stored in a "block," and these blocks are linked together in a "chain" through cryptographic
                            hashes. Consensus mechanisms, like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake, validate and secure
                            transactions, preventing tampering and ensuring integrity across the network.</p>

                        <p>Blocks contain transaction data and a reference to the previous block's hash, ensuring a
                            secure and immutable chain. Consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Work, require solving
                            complex problems to validate transactions, while Proof of Stake relies on participantsâ€™
                            stakes. These methods maintain blockchain integrity, preventing fraud and ensuring trust
                            without a central authority.</p>

                        <h2>Types of Blockchains</h2>
                        <p>Blockchains come in three primary types: public, private, and permissioned. Public
                            blockchains are open and decentralized, like Bitcoin. Private blockchains are restricted to
                            specific users within an organization. Permissioned blockchains, used in consortiums,
                            combine elements of both, offering controlled access while enabling collaboration.</p>

                            blockchains, often used in consortia, combine aspects of both public and private systems,
                            providing controlled access and governance while enabling collaboration among various
                            entities.</p>

                        <p>Blockchain security relies on cryptographic techniques such as hashing and key encryption.
                            Hash functions ensure data integrity by creating unique identifiers for each block, while
                            public and private keys secure transactions. Consensus mechanisms validate blocks,
                            preventing fraud and ensuring the security of the entire network.</p>
